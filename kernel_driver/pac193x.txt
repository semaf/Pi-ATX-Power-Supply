* Microchip pac1934/2/1 chip family of energy monitors (ADC)

The node for this driver must be a child node of a I2C controller, hence
all mandatory properties for your controller must be specified. See directory:

        Documentation/devicetree/bindings/i2c

for more details.

Required properties:
  - compatible: Should be one of
		"microchip,pac1934"
		"microchip,pac1932"
		"microchip,pac1931"
		
  - reg: Should contain the pac1934/2/1 I2C address

  - samp-rate: This is the default chip's sampling rate. It can be one of 
  following values: 8, 64, 256, 1024 samples per second
  
Required subnodes:

The ADC channels are configured as subnodes of the ADC. All the chip's 
channels are sampling at the speed specified by the "samp-rate"
For each pac193x variant there should be a certain number of subnodes
which will be equal to the number of physical channels built in the part 

Required channel node properties:

Optional channel node properties:
  - channel_enabled: A boolean property. Indicates whether the given channel
    is enabled

	- bi-dir: A boolean property. Indicated whether the given channel is set
    for bi-directional energy and power computation

	- uohms-shunt-res: 
    Value type: <u32>
	Definition: Value, in micro Ohms, of the current sense shunt resistor 
	            for the given channel

	- rail-name - An optional string to name a certain channel
  
Example:
&i2c0 {
	pac193x@10 {
		compatible = "microchip,pac1934";
		reg = <0x10>;
		samp-rate = <64>;
		status = "okay";

		ch1: channel@0 {
			bi-dir;
			uohms-shunt-res = <1000>; /* shunt resistor is 1 milliohm */
			rail-name = "CPU";
			channel_enabled;
		};

		ch2: channel@1 {
			/* uni-directional channel because of missing "bi-dir" property */
			uohms-shunt-res = <10000>; /* shunt resistor is 10 milliohm */
			rail-name = "GPU";
			channel_enabled;
		};

		ch3: channel@2 {
			/* channel disabled - no boolean property "channel_enabled" present */
		};

		ch4: channel@3 {
			bi-dir;
			uohms-shunt-res = <1000000>; /* shunt resistor is 1 ohm */
			rail-name = "NET";
			channel_enabled;
		};
	};
};

This device node describes a pac1934 chip sitting on i2c0 bus
with address 0x10.
The initial sampling rate for all the channels is set to 64 samples/second
Channels 1, 2 and 4 are enabled while channel 3 is disabled
Each channel has its own sense resistor values in micro-ohms.
Channels 1 and 4 are set for bi-directional operation, while
channel 2 works in uni-directional mode.
